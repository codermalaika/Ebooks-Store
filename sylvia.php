      <br>  <li> <b>What was Sylvia Plath's cause of death?</b> - "What drove Sylvia Plath to her death was painfully clear to her psychiatrist: clinical depression. But after the acclaimed poet, just 30 years old, committed suicide on this day, Feb. 11, in 1963, her friends, fans, and biographers were eager to blame the tragedy instead on a flesh-and-blood villain. "</li>
      <br>  <li> <b>Was Sylvia Plath in love with her father?</b> - "As such, Plath's relationship with her father in terms of sexual and emotional attraction is a complicated matter: Plath is both repulsed by her father and deeply attached to him emotionally. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Was Sylvia Plath famous before she died?</b> - "Though she's considered a pioneer of the confessional poetry style, Sylvia Plath was not widely famous when she died by suicide in 1963 at age 30. But her legacy has long outgrown her untimely death: Her collections of poetry and one novel, most published posthumously, are still read, debated, and quoted reverently. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>How old was Sylvia Plath when she died?</b> - "They found Plath dead with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. She was 30 years old.        "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>What was Sylvia Plath's trauma?</b> - "In Plath's life, trauma is two incidents: the second awakens the first. The death of her father was the first trauma that went peacefully and was not felt by her. Her mind threw a heavy cloak over the tragic event. It was not felt until 1961 when Plath experienced the second shock which was the loss of her fetus "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Was Sylvia Plath a feminist?</b> - "Plath was a major figure of the confessional poetry movement and often hailed as an important feminist writer. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Who took care of Sylvia Plath's children after her death?</b> - " After Plath's suicide, Hughes moved Wevill into Court Green (the Devon home at North Tawton he had bought with Plath), where Wevill helped care for Hughes's and Plath's two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Wevill was reportedly haunted by Plath's memory; she even began using things that had once belonged to Plath."</li>
      <br> <li> <b>What is Sylvia Plath's poetry mainly about?</b> - "In the New York Times Book Review, Joyce Carol Oates described Plath as “one of the most celebrated and controversial of postwar poets writing in English.” Intensely autobiographical, Plath's poems explore her own mental anguish, her troubled marriage to fellow poet Ted Hughes, her unresolved conflicts with her parents ...

        <h1><i>Early Life And Works:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"Sylvia Plath was born on October 27, 1932, in Boston, Massachusetts.[4][5] Her mother, Aurelia Schober Plath (1906–1994), was a second-generation American of Austrian descent, and her father, Otto Plath (1885–1940), was from Grabow, Germany. Plath's father was an entomologist and a professor of biology at Boston University who wrote a book about bumblebees.

          On April 27, 1935, Plath's brother Warren was born. In 1936 the family moved from 24 Prince Street in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to 92 Johnson Avenue, Winthrop, Massachusetts. Plath's mother, Aurelia, with Plath's maternal grandparents, the Schobers, had lived since 1920 in a section of Winthrop called Point Shirley, a location mentioned in Plath's poetry. While living in Winthrop, eight-year-old Plath published her first poem in the Boston Herald's children's section. Over the next few years, Plath published multiple poems in regional magazines and newspapers. At age 11, Plath began keeping a journal.[10] In addition to writing, she showed early promise as an artist, winning an award for her paintings from the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in 1947. "Even in her youth, Plath was ambitiously driven to succeed."
          
          Otto Plath died on November 5, 1940, a week and a half after Sylvia's eighth birthday, of complications following the amputation of a foot due to untreated diabetes. He had become ill shortly after a close friend died of lung cancer. Comparing the similarities between his friend's symptoms and his own, Otto became convinced that he, too, had lung cancer and did not seek treatment until his diabetes had progressed too far. Raised as a Unitarian, Plath experienced a loss of faith after her father's death and remained ambivalent about religion throughout her life. Her father was buried in Winthrop Cemetery in Massachusetts. A visit to her father's grave later prompted Plath to write the poem "Electra on Azalea Path"."</p>
        <br>
        <h1><i> College Years And Depression:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"In 1950, Plath attended Smith College, a private women's liberal arts college in Massachusetts. She excelled academically. While at Smith, she lived in Lawrence House, and a plaque can be found outside her old room. She edited The Smith Review. After her third year of college, Plath was awarded a coveted position as a guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City.[5] The experience was not what she had hoped for, and many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar.[14]

          She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas — a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, "more than life itself". She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, but he was already on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough "courage" to kill herself.[15][a] During this time she was not accepted into a Harvard writing seminar with author Frank O'Connor.[5] Following ECT for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt on August 24, 1953,[17] by crawling under the front porch and taking her mother's sleeping pills.[18]
          
          
          Sidgwick Hall at Newnham College
          She survived this first suicide attempt, later writing that she "blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion". She spent the next six months in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment under the care of Ruth Beuscher.[5] Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith Scholarship were paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty, who also recovered from a mental breakdown.[19] According to Plath's biographer Andrew Wilson, Olive Higgins Prouty "would take Dr Tillotson to task for the badly managed ECT, blaming him for Sylvia's suicide attempt"</p>
        <br>
        <h1><i> Career And Marriage:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"The couple married on June 16, 1956, at St George the Martyr, Holborn in London (now in the Borough of Camden) with Plath's mother in attendance, and spent their honeymoon in Paris and Benidorm. Plath returned to Newnham in October to begin her second year.[5] During this time, they both became deeply interested in astrology and the supernatural, using ouija boards.[25]

          In June 1957, Plath and Hughes moved to the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write,[20] and in the middle of 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and, in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).[20]
          
          Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her experience and she did so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to consider herself as a more serious, focused poet and short story writer.[5] At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W.S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend.[26] Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.[5]
          
          
          Chalcot Square, near Primrose Hill in London, Plath and Hughes' home from 1959
          Plath and Hughes traveled across Canada and the United States, staying at the Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs, New York in late 1959. Plath says that it was here that she learned "to be true to my own weirdnesses", but she remained anxious about writing confessionally, from deeply personal and private material.[5][27] The couple moved back to England in December 1959 and lived in London at 3 Chalcot Square, near the Primrose Hill area of Regent's Park, where an English Heritage plaque records Plath's residence.[28][29] Their daughter Frieda was born on April 1, 1960, and in October, Plath published The Colossus, her first collection of poetry.[28]
          
          In February 1961, Plath's second pregnancy ended in miscarriage; several of her poems, including "Parliament Hill Fields", address this event.[30] In a letter to her therapist, Plath wrote that Hughes beat her two days before the miscarriage.[31] In August she finished her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar and immediately after this, the family moved to Court Green in the small market town of North Tawton. Nicholas was born in January 1962.[28] In mid-1962, Plath and Hughes began to keep bees, which would be the subject of many Plath poems"</p>
        <br>
        <h1><i> Following Plath's Death:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"An inquest was held on February 15 and gave a ruling of suicide as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.[48] Hughes was devastated, they had been separated for six months, due to his affair with Assia Wevill. In a letter to an old friend of Plath from Smith College, he wrote "That's the end of my life. The rest is posthumous."[35][49] Wevill also committed suicide, using a gas stove, six years later.

          Plath's gravestone, in Heptonstall's parish churchyard of St Thomas the Apostle bears the inscription that Hughes chose for her:[50] "Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted." Biographers attribute the source of the quote to the Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita[50] or to the 16th-century Buddhist novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en.[51][52]
          
          Plath's daughter Frieda Hughes is a writer and artist. On March 16, 2009, Plath's son Nicholas Hughes hanged himself at his home in Fairbanks, Alaska, following a history of depression"</p>
