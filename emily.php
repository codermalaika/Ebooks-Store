        <li> <b>Born</b> - July 30, 1818, Thornton, United Kingdom</li>
      <br>  <li> <b>What was Emily Brontë famous for?</b> - "Emily Brontë (1818–1848) was an English novelist and poet. Best-known for her novel Wuthering Heights (1847), she also wrote over 200 poems which her sister Charlotte Brontë thought had 'a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating'. "</li>
      <br>  <li> <b>What was Emily Brontë cause of death?</b> - "The widely accepted story of how the 19th-century English novelist died comes from her sister, Charlotte, who published a short 'Biographical Notice' following Emily's death from tuberculosis, on December 19, 1848. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>What inspired Emily Brontë to write Wuthering Heights?</b> - "The inspiration for Wuthering Heights is often identified as High Sunderland Hall, a large Gothic hall where Emily Brontë worked briefly as a governess. The hall was full of elaborate and grotesque looking statues similar to those Lockwood describes in his first impression of Wuthering Heights in Chapter 1. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>At what age did Emily Brontë write Wuthering Heights?</b> - "Emily Brontë was 27 years old when she wrote Wuthering Heights. She began the novel in about October 1845 and finished it in June 1846, just before her 28th birthday. Wuthering Heights was first published in 1847, the year before Brontë died at the age of 30. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Is Wuthering Heights Based on a true story?</b> - "Wuthering Heights is not a true story. It is a novel and, by definition, a novel is a story imagined by the author. It is commonly classified as gothic fiction or a gothic tragedy, as it combines aspects of both the horror and mystery genre. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Was Emily Brontë a feminist?</b> - "Emily probably wasn't hugely aware of first-wave feminism. She didn't get out much and it was a bit after her time. Years after her death, she would be revered as a feminist icon. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Who was Emily Brontë in love with?</b> - "In fact, there's no evidence to suggest that Emily ever had an affair with anyone. "We certainly have no evidence for her ever having a love affair in her life. And she, of course, never married." Ann Dinsdale, the principal curator at the Brontë Parsonage Museum, told The Telegraph. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Was Emily Brontë religious?</b> - "There are those who believe that Emily Brontë, although influenced by her father's piety and role as a minister of the Church of England, rejected patriarchal Christianity in her works. The other primary body of scholarship argues that Emily Brontë is fundamentally Christian, although somewhat unorthodox. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>What happened in Wuthering Heights?</b> - "It follows the life of Heathcliff, a mysterious gypsy-like person, from childhood (about seven years old) to his death in his late thirties. Heathcliff rises in his adopted family and then is reduced to the status of a servant, running away when the young woman he loves decides to marry another. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Did Emily Brontë fall in love with a priest?</b> - "The short answer is that there's no evidence to support that Emily Brontë had an affair with her father's curate, William Weightman, O'Connor tells us. But he was a real person who did interact with the family, and Emily and her sisters did refer to him as “Celia Amelia.”"</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Who is the most famous Brontë?</b> - "Emily was perhaps the greatest of the three Brontë sisters, but the record of her life is extremely meagre, for she was silent and reserved and left no correspondence of interest, and her single novel darkens rather than solves the mystery of her spiritual existence."</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Is Emily Brontë a romantic poet?</b> - "Although historically located between the Romantic and Victorian eras, Brontë is rendered Romantic by countless critics, considered "romantic in her temper and phrasing" and aligned with all the canonical male Romantic poets (Fotherington 107-33). "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Who is better Brontë or Austen?</b> - "She turned out to have won the argument on the night, though not quite the vote. An audience poll at the end narrowly elected Austen as queen of English literature (51% to Brontë's 47%), but as the pre-debate split had been 55% to 24% with 21% don't knows, all the swing vote had gone to Brontë. "</li>
      <br> <li> <b>Who was Emily Brontë in love with?</b> - "Emily Brontë was never in love

        For someone who understood the varieties of love so well, it seems that Emily herself never knew romantic love. She was happiest in her own company, or with her beloved sister Anne. "</li>

        <h1><i>Early Life And Works:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"Emily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Brontë. The family was living on Market Street in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Emily was the second youngest of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell. In 1820, Emily's younger sister Anne, the last Brontë child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate.[4] In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.[4]

            When Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.[5] The younger children were to be cared for by Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt and Maria's sister.
            
            Emily's three elder sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.[6] At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a typhoid epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had tuberculosis, was sent home, where she died. Elizabeth died shortly after.
            
            The four youngest Brontë children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest women in their immediate family.[7]
            
            Charlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.[8] Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre.
            
            The three remaining sisters and their brother Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt Elizabeth Branwell. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.[9] Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Shelley, and Blackwood's Magazine.[10]
            
            
            Emily's Gondal poems
            Inspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, the children began to write stories, which they set in a number of invented imaginary worlds populated by their soldiers as well as their heroes, the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emily's work from this period survives, except for poems spoken by characters.[12][13] Initially, all four children shared in creating stories about a world called Angria.
            
            However, when Emily was 13, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and placenames, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some "diary papers", written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal.[14] The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the "noble savage": romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of "civilization".[15] Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Brontës' juvenilia, notably in Branwell's The Life of Alexander Percy, which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for Wuthering Heights.[16]
            
            At seventeen, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme homesickness and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that "Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall."[17] Emily returned home and Anne took her place.[18][a] At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own."</p>
        <br>
        <h1><i> Adulthood:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"Emily became a teacher at Law Hill School in Halifax beginning in September 1838, when she was twenty.[19] Her always fragile health soon broke under the stress of the 17-hour workday, and she returned home in April 1839.[20] Thereafter she remained at home, doing most of the cooking, ironing, and cleaning at Haworth. She taught herself German out of books and also practised the piano.[21]

            In 1842, Emily accompanied Charlotte to the Héger Pensionnat in Brussels, Belgium, where they attended the girls' academy run by Constantin Héger in the hope of perfecting their French and German before opening their school. Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying "I wish to be as God made me", which rendered her something of an outcast.[22] Nine of Emily's French essays survive from this period. Héger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily's character, writing that:
            
            She should have been a man – a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.[23]
            The two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame Héger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had, by this time, become a competent pianist and teacher and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music.[24] However, the illness and death of their aunt drove them to return to their father and Haworth.[25] In 1844, the sisters attempted to open a school in their house, but their plans were stymied by an inability to attract students to the remote area.[26]
            
            In 1844, Emily began going through all the poems she had written, recopying them neatly into two notebooks. One was labelled "Gondal Poems"; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems.[27][28] In the autumn of 1845, Charlotte discovered the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well. As co-authors of Gondal stories, Anne and Emily were accustomed to read their Gondal stories and poems to each other, while Charlotte was excluded from their privacy.[29] Around this time Emily had written one of her most famous poems "No coward soul is mine", probably as an answer to the violation of her privacy and her own transformation into a published writer.[30] Despite Charlotte's later claim, it was not her last poem.[31]
            
            In 1846, the sisters' poems were published in one volume as Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The Brontë sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was "Currer Bell", Emily was "Ellis Bell" and Anne was "Acton Bell".[32] Charlotte wrote in the 'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell' that their "ambiguous choice" was "dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice".[33] Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold,[34] they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs).[35] The Athenaeum reviewer praised Ellis Bell's work for its music and power, singling out his poems as the best: "Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted",[36] and The Critic reviewer recognised "the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect. "</p>
        <br>
        <h1><i> Personality And Character:</i></h1><br>
        <p>"Emily Brontë's solitary and reclusive nature has made her a mysterious figure and a challenge for biographers to assess.[38][39] Except for Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily's fellow student in Brussels, she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were "like twins", "inseparable companions" and "in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption".[40][41] In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through and instead the sisters went to York where Anne showed Emily York Minster. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters.[42]

            Charlotte Brontë remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her only shortly after her death, she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be called "Charlotte's smoke-screen", and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister's sanity. After Emily's death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a more acceptable (to her and the bourgeois reading public) model.[43] Biographer Claire O'Callaghan suggests that the trajectory of Brontë's legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte, concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily's death, but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte.[44] As O'Callaghan and others have noted, Charlotte was Gaskell's primary source of information on Emily's life and may have exaggerated or fabricated Emily's frailty and shyness to cast herself in the role of maternal saviour "</p>
